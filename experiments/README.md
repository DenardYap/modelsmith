kernel_test/ is what I am working on right now, trying to implement a General Matrix Multiplication (gemm) function for binary matrices and benchmark it (see). see kernel_test/benchmark.cpp and kernel_test/pack_matrix.cpp.

In late April, I also tinkered with PyTorch's 8-bit quantization, see benchmark.py and train.py for details.

Ignore transformer_from_scratch for now, I was brushing up my transformer's knowledge and reminding myself how to code a transformer.
